Bluetooth RC Car
================
This is the code for the product of my high-school senior exit project.

I am modifying an old remote-controlled car to run off of an Arduino equipped with a motor shield and a USB shield with a bluetooth transmitter plugged in.

There are two Arduino projects. One is for driving the car with a PS3 Dualshock controller (using either the joystick or its pan/tilt sensors). The other is for driving with an Android device. There is a phonegap application to complement the latter.
